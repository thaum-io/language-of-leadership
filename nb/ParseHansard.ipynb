Why should the residents of Bamaga, Palm Island, Mimili or Jigalong be treated any differently by their state governments? I welcome the response from the Northern Territory government in my negotiations and its commitment to $110 million a year, which I look forward to investing not only in partnership with the Northern Territory but in partnership with Aboriginal leadership and with Aboriginal control for the first time.\n"

To date, Queensland and Western Australia have not put a single dollar on the table when it comes to remote housing in either of those states. I will just repeat that: they haven't put a single dollar on the table when it comes to remote housing. So you should be asking Mick de Brenni and Peter Tinley, the housing ministers for Queensland and Western Australia, why no commitment has in fact been made.

It may well be beyond that figure, but that's the figure we were told. The remote panel recommended the key matters were: a recurring program must be funded to maintain existing houses, preserve functionality and increase the life of housing assets; investment for an additional 5,500 houses by 2028 is needed to continue the efforts on closing the gap on Indigenous disadvantage; the cost of a remote Indigenous housing program should be equally sharedâand I take the minister's point: it should be equally shared, not given up on because someone won't talk to youâbetween the Commonwealth and the other jurisdictions; and a regional governance structure should be established to facilitate better administration of the program.\n"

You have failed to deal with some of the basic problems in Indigenous communities in this country. You are too busy carving each other up, too busy fighting with each other and too busy defending the absolutely indefensible as a governmentâa rabble of a government, a government with no capacity to lead, a government with no economic policies and no social policies.

This is an extremely important issue that, it is very clear, needed very strong leadership from the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth has been investing in remote housingâin fact, in social housingâfor a long time, but in particular in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander housing. This is an absolutely essential area where the Commonwealth should be providing leadership, and it was very clear, even before the review came out, that there was a need for ongoing Commonwealth involvement and, in fact, an agreement with the states and territories around this issue. That was confirmed, of course, through the review document, which clearly points out in its leading recommendations:\n"

There has been huge disquiet in the sector about knowing the future of this program. Yes, the program to date has been addressing issues of overcrowding, but, as the review pointed out, more houses are needed.

We know that housing is absolutely fundamental to addressing issues of Closing the Gap. We need to be addressing issues around the social determinants of health, and we know that housing plays a critical role there. An issue we are yet to resolve is otitis media and the impact it has on Aboriginal children, and poor housing and overcrowding is a key component of that issue. We had a workshop in Perth the week before last, where we were talking about those essential social determinants of health to ensure that we can deal with this. Make no mistake, OM is at pandemic levels in this country. We have one of the highest rates of OM in the world, if not the highest. This is just one example of the issues that we are yet to resolve where housing plays an absolutely critical role. We have to reduce and get rid of overcrowding. We have to ensure that people can live in hygienic circumstances. As the review pointed out, we have to ensure that existing houses are maintained and we have preserve their functionality and increase the life of the housing assets. That is absolutely critical. But building more houses and addressing this issue in remote communities is absolutely essential. I have addressed OM in particular because it is an issue that I think is fundamental; it is a classic example of why we need to be addressing this issue.\n"

It has been commented that half of the housing problem is in the NT. Does that mean that half of the money is going to the NT? Why was the focus there first? I appreciate that there are some very important issues there. I have been in the communities a lot of times, so I understand the nature of those issues in the Northern Territory. But we also have those fundamental issues in Western Australia, as does Queensland. These are important issues that people want answers to. I put in a long list of questions at estimates, which I presume will go to the minister at some stage when the department has answered them. They are fundamentally important. Organisations also need to know whether this funding is going to continue. In terms of planning into the future, communities need to know. Employment programs will cease if there is not ongoing commitment to these programs in a timely manner.\n"

Yes, of course there has to be investment from the states and territories. But a much more conciliatory approach to negotiations, in a timely manner, should have occurred first instead of being reduced to this game of brinkmanship. From the outside, to a whole number of people, it looks like that is what is happening. Delays will cause very significant issues to building programs, to employment, to the outcomes that we are all looking for. So at the same time that we are talking about the Refresh program and updating Closing the Gap, we are back to basic principles of fighting over housing. That is essentially what we are talking about here. We are back to fighting over housing, and the delays that brings with it.\n"

You would have thought by now that we could have been addressing those issues in a timely manner. But, no, we're not. We're back to this issue yet again, with people waiting with bated breath to find out what funding will be available and what states are going to be putting in. As I said, it's fair enough that states are contributing as well. But it's all happening again at the very last minute.

The government are trying to withdraw the Commonwealth from these issues if they can possibly get away with it. It's time that this issue was resolved as a matter of urgency. That may mean getting the states together with the Territory to resolve this issue. It is absolutely critical that this issue be resolved, that there be certainty and that the recommendations be implemented, such as the additional investment with a recurrent program so that these sorts of debates don't have to be held every time a funding program is going to run out. We know, as was pointed out in the review, that 5,500 houses are needed by 2028. Let's get in place an ongoing recurrent program that deals with this issue so that we can accomplish the elimination of overcrowding, so that there is certainty for the program and so that there is certainty that we can have a Closing the Gap Refresh, knowing that a key component of that can be delivered. We are not going to close the gap if we don't address some of these fundamental social determinants, of which housing is a critical component. If we don't address that issue, we will fail to close the gap, and that has been pointed out by many people who have been contributing, particularly recently, on this extremely important area of investment, where the Commonwealth can show leadership and in fact must show leadership.\n"

Well, in the Northern Territory, the Chief Minister, Michael Gunner, and the housing minister, Gerry McCarthy, have worked on their preparation in terms of what they will offer with housing across the Northern Territory, and they have put forward $1.1 billion over 10 years.

The Commonwealth, thenâand I understand this to be the COAG meetingâin November, was alerted to the fact that the NT government 'remains committed to deliver the target of 300 new houses under the national partnership on remote housing, as per schedule F of the agreement, but the achievement of that target by 30 June this year is at risk, due to factors that are outside the Northern Territory government's control. These includeâagain, this is for the benefit of the Senate, to understand the intricacies that impact on the lives of First Nations peoples in this country. The first issue here is leasing. Delays in securing land tenure have delayed contracts being awarded, most notably in the communities of Yarralin, Pirlangimpi and Mutitjulu. There are seasonal impacts. The wet season in the Northern Territory has considerable impact on the ability to deliver capital works, and the 2017-18 wet season has commenced early in some parts of the Northern Territory, including at Amanbidji, a community programmed to receive six new replacement houses. The third area of concern, in terms of these risk factors, is transitional accommodation. Capital works cannot commence in a community until appropriate accommodation is provided for people who need to move from a dilapidated house or those needing a new house, so they can be accommodated somewhere in the interim. So works have to be aligned to ensure transitional housing is in place, to avoid delays.\n"

I know that as part of the conversations that are now taking place around closing the gap, it is absolutely critical that this government looks at the importance of housing and the lack of it, and the impact that it's having on the very policy that it stands up to give a report on in the House in February every year on the life expectancy of First Nations people.

The story is that a group of Aboriginal workers walked off the job at a cattle station in the NT over 44 years ago to protest about a lack of pay and about mistreatment. Today, more than 50,000 hectares belong to them. Fifty thousand hectares of land were returned at that moment. I was there, the minister was there, the Northern Land Council was there and all the men, women and children of the VRD region were there.

We know that housing is a critical aspect of improving the lives of everyone, and the ones who need it the most in this particular instance are the First Nations people of our country.

No-one could have confidence that the Turnbull government has a commitment to remote housing with what we're seeing in how this policy is playing out and what we've heard today. We know this is not just a housing crisis; it's a jobs crisis. While the current program is not perfect, it's not adequate to the degree that's needed, what it has done is provide not only some houses but also desperately needed jobs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.

When he got to the four-minute mark he decided to blither on to personal insults and to say that the National Party doesn't care about Indigenous people. I guess we're used to it. There are some people in this placeâthere's certainly oneâwho everybody in Australia should factor in. He is so offensive in his nature that he should just be ignored. We do our best under a torrent of specific and personal offence given by this man. We don't forgive him. He's just what he is and we just ignore it.

He said, 'Indigenous homelessness has increased.' Perhaps I can point him to a number of articles and statistics that he should inform himself ofâafter all, this is his shadow portfolio. The number of Indigenous people counted as homeless has fallen by 12.3 per cent in the five years leading up to 2016, and it goes on. I'm not suggesting in any circumstance that that is okay, but to say that it's gone up not down, I think, is something he won't ever be held to account for.

We have ownership by Aboriginal people and the land council. It is significant reform not only in the amount of money that goes in but in how it is provided. On all of those predictions, we can reach them in half the time if we can build twice as many houses, so this is an outcome that is achievable.\n"

I'm very much aware of the program. And in Queensland assertions were made that everyone has to finish on the 30 June 2018 by no less than the Queensland local government authority, mostly from North Queensland. I had quite a large contingent come and see me to say they were concerned. I said, 'That's an odd concern to have. I'm not like that. Why would we do that?' They said, 'It was put to us by Minister De Brenni directly that I had written a letter to him saying that everyone has to put pens down on 30 June 2018.'

They run their budget on an annual basis, unlike the Commonwealthâwe run our budget over three-year forward estimates. That is entirely a matter for them. It is just a different way in terms of scale. I am not criticising them for that. They've indicated they're going to put $110 million in a fund, not in their own budget, and I've said that we'll match whatever you put in that fund. They indicated there's one year's funding in the fund and they are going to get back to me about the second year, and I hope to have it on the second year. We'll be matching the funding they put in there. As I have indicated, you can't ask for much more than doubling the investment in some of the most needy parts of Australia. That opportunity is, in fact, available to Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia. As I indicated earlier, I can give some grace to the South Australian government, because they've just been in caretaker mode and they're unable to negotiate through lettersâthat's just a factâbut it is very important that we continue to make a joint effort.\n"

I think people need to know how many dollars they have provided from their own budgets over the last decade. The Commonwealth are clear: we've invested $5.4 billion. That's been our investment in NPARIH. We've also made some investment through special purpose payments, national partnerships and Commonwealth rent assistance. Commonwealth rent assistance puts it up to about $49 billion or $50 billion in the last decade. Commonwealth rent assistance will take that apart. Whilst it's a huge number, I think we need to set that aside and just look at those funds that were available for investment by the states and territories that were funds given to them. I know that, because we have records of the funds that have been provided to the Queensland government, to the Western Australian government, to the South Australian government and to the Northern Territory government over that period of time.\n"

I've asked them if they would provide the number of houses that have been built by them in those areas. I've also asked them: 'How many dollars are from the Commonwealth funds that we provided you for public housing for your most needy?' Between the special purpose payments and the national partnerships on homelessness, over the last decade there's been about $5.5 billion in those specific areas. That's an investment that could've been made to the most needy in those jurisdictions. The most needy live in those remote areas. That $5.5 billion is almost the same as the Commonwealth amount, isn't it, Senator Dodson? Imagine what you could do with that. I've asked them: 'How did you go with that, and how much have you invested?' Western Australia had $1.5 billion of discretionary funds that they could have invested over the last decade, Queensland had $2.6 billion, South Australia had a tad over $1 billion and the Northern Territory had $300,000. That's the discretionary funding that has been allocated over the last decade for investment in public housing. I wanted to know that. I think it's very important we all know that.\n"

I have to say, Queensland has written me back a highly political letter. You would have seen that. It doesn't tell me anything, and it certainly doesn't answer those questions. The most fundamental question, of course, is: how much are you going to put on the table in the future, given what you've just done?

The funds that they get they're now allocating to the most in need, and their remote areas they're going to be able to service. Victoria have taken the same approach. They're going to be servicing those people most in need. Tasmania has said, 'I'm going to take over my responsibilities as a state, and a fundamental responsibility is the provision of public housing.' Yes, the Commonwealth help out in certain ways.

I suspect the answer is zero. It is just depressing to think about why that would be the case. Perhaps because of the colour of someone's skin you would decide that these discretionary funds are not available to an entire demographic because they happen to live in remote areas.

Yes, they can only do it year by year, but they've indicated that about $110 million a year will be forthcoming. We've indicated that we'll meet that. We've also indicated that it will be separate from the Northern Territory government's budget and that it will be overseen by including the land councils in that. That's a significant move forward.

Under the new compliance framework, while jobseekers are able to appeal any financial penalty, they will not receive payment pending the outcome of the appeal or payment pending review. However, jobseekers will be paid back pay if their appeal is successful. Under the current compliance framework, in practice, payment pending review is only available for eight-week serious failure penalties and unemployment non-payment periods, which will no longer exist under the new framework. Payment pending review is currently not available for the majority of penalty types.\n"

The jobseeker's capabilities will also generally have been assessed twice, by both their provider and Human Services, before any penalties are applied. These arrangements are intended to ensure that only those jobseekers who are fully capable of meeting their requirements, but deliberately choose not to, will lose payment. The intention is to provide such jobseekers with a strong incentive to change their behaviour or find work. Allowing payment pending review for such jobseekers would significantly undermine this incentive effect.\n"

In effect, what we've got is people being able to access the first appeals process, the departmental appeals process and then the AAT. For a start, we know the AAT takes quite a long period of timeâcertainly more than the four weeks. Well, it's seven weeks, but the maximum one-time suspension is four weeks, and it certainly takes longer than that.\n"

Following that, if somebody has appealed and they do their four weeksâsay it's the four-week oneâwhat happens if they're still under appeal? Do they still go back? If they are still appealingâsay it's an AAT or departmental one, but it's more likely AAT because they take longerâdo they go back to the start of the process? What happens if they are still under appeal? Is that clear? So they've appealed and they've actually done their four weeks off income supportâyou've just said they would not be receiving income support.

If a jobseeker had no issues when they underwent their compliance assessment, but their circumstances change while they're in the penalty phase, they will remain in the penalty phase but will have their requirements adjusted, if necessary, to ensure that they can meet them. They do not return to the demerits phase because they were capable of meeting the requirements when they incurred their demerits and underwent their capability assessment. However, if the jobseeker does fail to meet a requirement, Centrelink will not apply a penalty if the jobseeker's barriers provide a reasonable excuse for failure. Also, providers would continue to monitor jobseeker requirements and take personal circumstances into account following any further noncompliance. If a jobseeker reveals a previously undisclosed barrier whilst in the penalty phase, and it results in the retrospective application of an activity test exemption, any demerit incurred within the exemption period will be removed and they will return to the demerits phase. I hope that gives you a little bit more in terms of what we were discussing last night.\n"

We're extremely concerned that, in practice, this means that a person can be asked to provide information to prove that they've not complied with their obligations as a welfare recipient, and any information provided can be used as evidence against them. You have to ask yourself where the onus of proof is here. I've certainly seen, in relation to robo-debt, a considerable reversal of that onus within DHS. I'm very concerned that the information can also be used as evidence that a person has not fully complied with the requirements to give information or documents, or has provided false or misleading information or has engaged in forgery.\n"

For example, a new section 197A will be inserted into the Social Security (Administration) Act to clarify the effect of the privilege against self-incrimination on a person's obligation to respond to a statutory demand. Subsection 197A(1) provides that a person is not excused from giving information or producing a document or record that may incriminate them or expose them to a penalty. In short, that person cannot refuse to provide the information or document on the grounds that it may incriminate them. Well-established law dictates that a person cannot be compelled to convict themselves from their own words, and subsection 197A(2) section applies to this principle. Section 197A(2) provides for what is called use or derivative use immunity for an individual providing information or documents in response to a statutory demand to produce. The subsection sets out that any information given or any document or record produced by an individual may not be admitted in evidence against the individual in criminal proceedings, with only limited exceptions.\n"

Generally, only information that is relevant to another person's social security payment under the social security law is sought from persons. For example, information may be sought from an employer about cash-in-hand income received by a social security recipient or from a financial institution about a social security recipient's financial assets, incomes and outgoings. Section 197A(2) ensures that only limited criminal consequences flow from the person's inability to refuse to provide information. The use and derivative use immunity in subsection 197A(2) is subject to certain exceptions.

He understands well how important the coal sector is for the economy of Queensland. The strength of the North and Central Queensland economies certainly does track the strength of the coal sector. Not only does Senator Macdonald know and support that but we saw in results in a poll published in The Sunday Mail on the weekend that 80 per cent of North and Central Queenslanders agree with the statement that the coal industry is very important to the economy and jobs in Central and Northern Queensland. That's why we support it and that's why we back it.\n"

This is great news for the coal sector because, as Senator Macdonald indicated in his question, the revenue from this sector that benefits Queensland and this country is substantial. There were $36 billion in exports last year from Queensland; nearly $3 billion in wages to over 20,000 employees; and $4 billion in royalties to the state of Queensland. In addition, $11 billion is spent by the coal sector on goods and services to supply that industry.\n"

He supplies goods to the mining sector and his business is intimately linked to the strength of that sector. It goes further than that. I met Roger Penrose last year at Great Keppel Island. He manages the resort there and is a third-generation miner. He understands the better the coal sector goes, the more people come out to the reef and the more people go through the tourism sector. If you want to support the economy of Northern and Central Queensland, you have to support the coal sector.\n"

You'd think the party that calls itself the Labor Party would be going to meet labourers and workers, but on Mr Shorten's recent holiday visit to North Queenslandâfunded by the Australian Conservation Foundationâhe literally flew over the Carmichael mine site and landed at the Doongmabulla Springs and had a look at the springs but didn't meet any people. I have been to the springs. They are important springs and we should protect them, but we should also protect people. We think springs are important but we also think jobs are important. We think birds are important, but we also think people are important. That's the approach that a proper party that wants to represent this nation would take.\n"

The answer to her question is no. The reality is that the Turnbull government's reforms are ensuring that schools across Australia are receiving fair, consistent funding. It sees growth in funding lift to around $23 to $25 billion over the next decade. We see real, consistent, needs based funding being applied. It means that non-government schools, regardless of their background, affiliation or otherwise will be funded based on their need.\n"

When the Gonski report was handed down the response of the then Labor government was to say, 'Let's do a bunch of special deals rather than apply the Gonski report.' In the context of the 2013 election, the then Labor government ripped $1.2 billion out of the schools-funding budget. They took that money away from states like Western Australia and Queensland and from the Northern Territory as well. Then they had the gall to come into this chamber and vote against the Turnbull government's application of the Gonski reforms. They voted against a model that was endorsed by David Gonski himself, that was endorsed by a number of other members of the original Gonski panel. Now, in a reversion right back to the start of Mr Shorten's response to the original Gonski report, they are trying to go back to do special deals. The truth is there is additional funding to core school sectors right around the country, to the independent sector, the Catholic sector and the government sector, but it is being delivered fairly and consistently on the basis of need.

In terms of additional funding, Catholic education around the country will this year receive around 4.7 per cent more funding than they received last year. Over the course of the next four years there is more than 20 per cent growth; over the course of the next decade, it is closer to 56 per cent. That is real, strong growth in funding into Catholic edâabove inflation and above wages growthâalong with real additional funding into public schools, who have been so critical today of the Labor Party's policy. And all of it will be delivered according to a consistent principle. The shame of those opposite is that you have thrown any principle out the door in favour of politicking. You have wasted the time of David Gonski and his panel, you have turned your back on their work and instead you just think you can buy votes in schools rather than fund them according to the needs of their students.\n"

Minister, my heart goes out to the many people who have been affected by the bushfires in Tathra and in south-western Victoria. They have suffered terrible losses and we must all come together to help them rebuild. I have spoken to many who have lost their homes after previous bushfiresâincluding some of my own neighbours. Like them, they have asked meâin fact, pleaded with meâto bring up the link between climate change and bushfires. They say that treating the symptoms and not the cause is putting them at risk. Minister, you say that now is not the right time to talk about climate change. What do you say to those many people who have called on us to say that right now is precisely the time to be talking about climate change and the impact it is having on them in their lives?\n"

It was the first meeting of its kind in Australia and an historic point in our engagement with ASEAN. There is no regional grouping of countries more important to Australia's security and prosperity. ASEAN as a group is our third largest trading partner, with two-way trade worth over $100 billion in the last financial year. As we noted during the special summit, we have the potential to do more, especially in investment.\n"

We are also working with ASEAN countries to keep our region safe. The foreign minister signed a counterterrorism memorandum of understanding with the Secretary-General of ASEAN, and the summit focused significantly on the region's evolving strategic environment. During the deliberations we conveyed Australia's support for the speedy conclusion of a China-ASEAN code of conduct for the South China Sea that is binding and consistent with the norms, practices and laws. The summit particularly demonstrates the Turnbull government's commitment to working with our ASEAN partners to promote economic growth and to strengthen the international rules based order.\n"

We are also very committed to building people-to-people links within our region. As a result of the special summit, we're establishing a new ASEAN-Australia Defence Postgraduate Scholarship program, through my department, which will see one person from each ASEAN nation awarded a scholarship to study here as part of a cohort. Commencing in early 2019, the program is designed to foster cooperation and equip ASEAN practitioners further in the field of regional defence engagement through a two-year Master of Strategic Studies postgraduate degree in Australia. This exemplifies the new era in our defence partnership with ASEAN and strengthens our substantial and practical contribution to regional security and prosperity, a number of aspects I saw in action last year in my visit to a number of ASEAN nations.\n"

On Friday of last week the foreign minister and I hosted the Australia-Indonesia 2+2 defence and foreign affairs ministerial meeting on the eve of the special summit itself, with Minister Marsudi and Minister Ryacudu. Both Australia and Indonesia are strongly committed to a region of peaceful development in line with ASEAN's vision. We had productive discussions on cybersecurity, on counterterrorism and on maritime security in particular. We also signed a Maritime Cooperation Plan of Action, which will drive increased cooperation across a number of areas, including economic development, maritime security and combating illegal fishing, to name just a few. So, whether it's bilaterally or through multinational forums such as ASEAN, we are absolutely committed to our efforts to promote economic growth and stability and security across our region.\n"

The question that I was asked in an interview was whether this was a blowout that cost the economy too much. The point I made was: no, it doesn't cost the economy too much at all because the money stays in the economy. Leaving the money with the people doesn't take it out of the economy; it leaves it with people that are better able to spend the money more efficiently on their own needs than the Labor Party in government would ever be.\n"

If you refund money to people that belongs to the people, does that have an impact on your budget bottom line? Yes, it means that your revenue is lower than it would be if you stole people's money, or if you stole more people's money. But it stays in the economy.

By that argument, you're saying, if we don't take 100 per cent of people's income out of people's pockets in tax, we are somehow imposing this massive cost on the budget. Well, do you know what? There is a limit to how much money you should take out of people's pockets, and no amount of Bill Shorten trying to pretend that he's going after the undeserving rich will hide the fact that he is putting his hands into the pockets of pensioners and self-funded retireesâthe people that Kim Beazley used to stand up for, and the people that Bill Shorten is selling out in his desperate pursuit of more cash to direct into his reckless spending promises.

Nearly two million Australian students took part in the national day across nearly 4,600 schools. These numbers, importantly, were more than double last year's participation level.

It's a day in which we acknowledge that there is no single silver bullet, but it allows school communities, encompassing parents and students, principals and teachers, to all come together to address the multifaceted approaches to raise awareness, to make sure that they are aware of the resources available to talk about bullying and to combat bullying, and where, of course, to take concerns and seek help when required.

Last Friday, the eSafety Commissioner, along with 13 wellbeing groups, issued a clear call to action: to encourage people to talk about bullying and violence with their children as early as possible; to make sure they seek help, and encourage children to reach out as soon as issues arise; and to ensure that there is a high level of awareness about what to do and how to get help. Of course, it is also underpinned by the Turnbull government's decisions and actions to provide greater support to youth mental health initiatives, such as headspace, to ensure that there is ongoing assistance available to students who need it. All up, this is critically important in terms of awareness: action in schools; action by parents; awareness of children about how to best stop bullying; how to create a culture of inclusion; but also, where bullying does occur, how to reach help as quickly and effectively as possible.\n"

The importance of franking credits to the Australian economy is very simple. Franking credits represent tax that has already been paid by companies on shareholders' behalf. To deny the use of credits and refunds for excess tax is double taxation. It results in both corporate tax and personal income tax being paid on the same income.\n"

But to deny the use of credits and refunds for excess tax is double taxation. The Labor Party, of course, in their policy document back in 1998, said that they would complete the implementation of the imputation system, and that Labor would: 'provide a cash refund for those shareholders who can't make use of their imputation credits because they do not pay income tax. This will be a significant benefit for older Australians, especially self-funded retirees on lower incomes.'\n"

Today they want to rip, by their own admission, $60 billion away from more than one million retirees and pensioners, and now they say that is reform. Two decades ago Labor said that refundsâand I'm quoting themâ'will ensure that investors who currently pay little or no tax will not be unfairly disadvantaged'. That's on page 41 of their policy. But that was Labor then. That was when Labor actually cared about the self-funded retirees on lower incomes. Now they are ripping away $60 billion from more than one million pensioners and self-funded retirees, but this is supposedly only affecting the wealthy. In reality, those on higher incomes are unaffected by Labor's $60 billion tax grab, and that is the truth.\n"

The initiatives of this government are supporting all hardworking small businesses across Australia. Whilst those opposite oppose corporate tax cuts, instant asset write-offs and the TPPâand they still can't work out whether they are pro mining or anti miningâit is becoming painfully clear that only a coalition government stands for small business and Indigenous entrepreneurs. We know that Indigenous businesses face barriers to success other than just the Labor Party. Undercapitalisation has flowed from a lot of historical policies. So through our Indigenous Business Sector Strategy, which the Prime Minister recently launched, we have a suite of new initiatives to help overcome historical disadvantage and grow the sector to parity rates.\n"

We know that the Indigenous businesses that are winning contracts under the Indigenous Procurement Policy have a workforce that is 41 per cent Indigenous, on average, which is 60 times that of other Australian businesses, which have workforces that are around 0.7 per cent Indigenous. This is reflected in the results. Since the last census there's been a 30 per cent increase in the number of Indigenous businesses compared with the last census and a 23.3 per cent increase in the number of Indigenous Australians in a job. Our policies across the board are working. We're getting record numbers of people into jobs, and we're giving some of the most disadvantaged Australians the dignity of work. (Time expired)\n"

This funding ensures that athletes with a disability have access to high-quality infrastructure, support and opportunities. We also provide a total of over $1.2 million through the ASC to these organisations for participation, aiming to create an inclusive environment and get more Australians with a disability participating in sport more often. Finally, our government is focused on delivering a sports plan developed around key pillars of participation, preventive health through physical activity, integrity and high performance. Grassroots participation in sport and physical activity is a particular priority of the government, given the role it plays in supporting the health and wellbeing of Australians. I'm committed as sports minister to getting more Australians moving more often. This will be outlined in our Sport Plan, which will be presented later.\n"

He was injured at one stage and gassed at one stage, but fortuitously he returned to South Australia after 3Â½ years at the front and then married my grandmother. Coming back from that war, he was looking for employment. He was an accountant before he left, but unfortunately it was a very difficult time for Irish people and particularly Irish Catholics in South Australia, and they were discriminated against.

I think he means 30 pieces of silver, but he said 'a few pieces of silver'.

There's now an opportunity for Senator Birmingham to withdraw those comments. I'd strongly urge Senator Birmingham to take the opportunity now to come into this place, come into this chamber and say 'Yes, my comments were inappropriate.' A week and a half out from Easter, this is not the way he should be making references to members of the Victorian Catholic education office.

There are no cuts to school funding from this government. The Quality Schools package in fact delivers an extra $25.3 billion on top of the 2016-17 budget in recurrent school funding over the next 10 years. That's 10 years out to 2027âa very solid and serious commitment to the funding of all students in every education sector of Australia over the next decade. That is both significant and very important. Funding for Catholic schools, in fact, is estimated to grow from $6.3 billion in 2017 to $6.6 billion in 2018, to $7.6 billion in 2021 and to $9.9 billion in 2027. The Catholic schools system will receive a total of $28.4 billion in Commonwealth recurrent funding over the four years from 2018 to 2021. What we are doing here is providing significant and accounted-for funding for all parts of the education sector, including the Catholic education sector, over the next 10 years. This is an average per-student increase in the Catholic sector of 3.7 per cent over the next decade, clearly higher than inflation.\n"

The move to a six-year transition for schools or systems below the targeted Commonwealth shares of the funding standard provides additional funding compared to the 10-year transition that was originally proposed. We also have the National School Resourcing Board undertaking a review of socioeconomic status, score methodology and current capacity to contribute arrangements for non-government schools and systems. This will look at the funding in this area and ensure that it is adequate. The board has already met with representatives from the Catholic schools sector, including principals from Victoria. The government will provide additional funding to support transition to the new funding arrangements for ACT Catholic schools.\n"

What's most important for the schools sector is to know what's coming, when it's coming, to be able to plan for increases in students and to be able to plan for the educational needs of those students over time. So what we need are numbers that can be believedânot fantasy numbers, which is usually what we get from the other side. Here we have $25.3 billion in recurrent funding over 10 years. That brings the total Commonwealth recurrent funding to almost $250 billion out to 2027. This is real needs based funding. The real needs based funding is provided and grows from $17Â½ billion this year to $31 billion in 2027. This is dealing with the education system in a fair way. It's giving students what they need, it's giving the various parts of the education system certainty going forward and it is fair across all parts of the education system.\n"

Today, you've got this minister claiming that the School Resourcing Board is doing work that Labor is ignoring. That is simply not true. What Labor said in its letter referred to by Senator Brockman, as we have consistently said since this fabrication of Gonski 2, was that Labor would return the $17 billion to government and non-government schools that this minister has ripped out.

I'm authorised to say, Senator Farrell, that I found your history of your Irish ancestors and the First World War very interestingâalmost as interesting, I might say, as Senator Simon Birmingham's Irish grandfather, who lost a leg at Polygon Wood, a major battle in World War I. Simon's grandfather, Patrick O'Loghlen, would probably have shared the battlefields with Senator Farrell's forebears, and I hope they got on well there together.\n"

They joined together a few years ago to form Columba College and are the recipients of a $4 million grant from the Turnbull government to do some wonderful extensions to their science blocks, to their school rooms, joining some work that the parents of that school did in improving the school playing fields, the quadrangle and the central meeting area. It was a wonderful experience I had on Friday, and I have many of them in North Queensland, more often than not at Catholic schools. And I mentionânot that it mattersâthat I'm not a Catholic myself. But I love going to Catholic schools. They do wonderful work, and all credit to Columba College Principal Mr Daniel McShea. Congratulations, Sir, on the wonderful work that you and the P&C and all of your staff do there, and congratulations to the wonderful young people at that school.\n"

I remind Senator Collins that actually Professor Gonski stood with the Prime Minister and Senator Birmingham when the new, wonderful package increasing funding to all school children was announced.

It's quite remarkableâwhen we've gone through a by-election in Batman, where this was a significant issue, particularly in the last week of the campaign, and where Labor put on record its commitment to supporting Catholic educationâand quite interesting that those opposite really dismiss it. They can say, 'Well, that contest in Batman was just Labor versus the Greens; it wasn't really consequential for the Liberals and Nationals.' But what they need to know is: what happened in Batman is going to happen and be replicated right across Australia by the time the next election comes around. I know what families will believe when it comes to school funding, and that's not the spin from those opposite. They'll believe the information coming out from the sector that their children go to school at, and that is going to be rammed home to them. And that's what we saw in Batman.\n"

We see that fight from Tony Abbott, the former Prime Minister. He's prepared to bell the cat and say what is actually happening out there in the community.

We saw it during the Senate estimates process, with Senator Cash and her comments about the staffers in Bill Shorten's office. Neither one of them apologised. Neither one of them have said that they did the wrong thing. They really backed those comments in. And we've seen the same from Senator Birmingham in the last 48 hours as well. You would really hope that there would be a higher standard from a federal cabinet minister, and you would also hope that there would be a higher standard from the government that would pull these people into line. But we see none of that from those opposite.\n"

He went on to say that Catholic schools would 'suffer a big loss in funding'. That was coming from a member of their governmentâindeed, the former Prime Ministerâcompletely contradicting what we hear from ministers and what we've seen from the contribution of other members in this debate so far today.\n"

But this is actually going to the ongoing funding of those schools. As someone who spends a lot of time in Queensland, and regional Queensland in particular, I know the concern that these schools are going to have. Already the opportunities for kids in regional Queensland and other parts of regional Australia aren't as great as they are for those from capital cities. Any further funding divide is only going to accentuate those problems, so there are going to be fewer opportunities for those kids from lower socioeconomic areas, from remote areas, to get the start in life that they need through primary school and through high school. This is what former Prime Minister Abbott is actually laying on the table. Those opposite who repeat the lines from Senator Birmingham and stick to the script are going to pay a price for this when it comes to the election, because parents understand this issue. From what I can pick up when I'm picking my kids up from school, parents absolutely know every issue going on in their school, as you'd expect them to. They understand this issue, and when it comes closer to the federal election they will increasingly look to who they are going to take their advice from about who is going to be better for their schools when it comes to ongoing funding.\n"

In February 2017, we transitioned to a new home-care system which gives consumers more choice and control over their care. This new system for the first time allows us to better understand the extent of demand for home care packages and uncovers the extent of the problem left by the former Labor government. In September 2017, we announced the release of 6,000 additional level 3 and 4 home care packages over 2017-18, more than doubling the planned growth of high-level packages this year. We are now releasing around 3,000 home care packages on a weekly basis. This is a record delivery of home care packages and supports the minister's statement of a positive trajectory.\n"

Currently, the Fair Work Commission has very limited ability to do anything other than effectively rubber-stamp a merger approved by just a bare majority of members. It's hard to see how a bare majority was even reached in the current merger of interests between the CFMEU, the Maritime Union and the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union. Less than six per cent of members of the three unions voted in favour of the merger, and CFMEU members were denied the ability to even vote. It is only right that a public interest test applies and that interested parties have their views considered before the Fair Work Commission.\n"

But, given the need for state and territory support, we want to work with them to ensure they're not worse off through a loss in GST revenue. The fact is that the Liberals have little interest in making this reality. There's been a lot of talk but no leadership or action. The Howard government imposed the GST on sanitary products when the tax was first introduced. In 2015, then Treasurer Joe Hockey sought to blame the Australian Democrats for the impost, saying they had not excluded the products from the GST during negotiations on the tax. In 2015, Hockey said that GST should be removed from sanitary products and undertook to raise the issue with state treasurers. However, then Prime Minister Tony Abbott ruled out a change within days. In 2015, four Labor states and the then Liberal-National Northern Territory government supported removing the tampon tax. Federal Labor will continue to work with the states and territories and will have more to say in the future.\n"

A comprehensive report by the state's Chief Health Officer found imported brass fittings to be the likely cause of lead contamination in the hospital's drinking water, which has contributed to lengthy delays in its opening. The report found the fittings had corroded, leaching lead into the water system. It has cost millions of dollars to try and rectify these problems, and the opening of this much-needed children's hospital has been delayed by over 2Â½ years. Last month it was revealed that there was also lead in the water at the drinking fountains at Perth's new billion-dollar stadium.\n"

TheSunday Times newspaper in Perth reported at the weekend that they had been contacted by plumbers who say they are seeing more and more defective parts which don't comply with the WaterMark Certification Scheme, which exists to ensure products are safe and fit for purpose. They blame a massive loophole that allows hardware stores to sell taps and other plumbing products that aren't WaterMark certified, even though plumbers risk penalties if they install these fittings.

As a former tradesman and someone who has real-life experience on building sites, I have spoken to a few colleagues in the industry and they have told me of recent encounters where cheap imported plumbing products, which have the potential to leach lead, have been fitted. At the same time, however, another problem has emerged, with the importation of counterfeit products that pose as being WaterMark certified but in actual fact are not.

Clearly it deserves support, as does any regulation or law deserve support. I know there is one union around the country, the CFMEU, that thinks that laws are made for everybody else except it. It seems to think that it can choose which laws it will abide by and which laws it will ignore, but the rest of Australia agrees that laws are in place to abide by, even if sometimes we don't think they're appropriate. As law-abiding citizens, we should actually abide by them. What Senator Burston and the One Nation party have done with this motion is to highlight the inconsistencies in regulation, or perhaps enforcement, of the national building code around Australia. I thank Senator Burston for raising this matter; I thank Senator Georgiou for his opening remarks, which highlight the issues of concern. They are no doubt of concern not only to the movers but also, I would imagine, to all of us in this chamber.\n"

We do recognise that we need to continue to work hard to ensure that Australians can continue to have that trust in our built environment. The federal government does not have legislative or regulatory power in this area, but it has an important role in working with the states and territories to ensure the safety of buildings. I congratulate the Minister for Small and Family Business, the Workplace and Deregulation, the Hon. Craig Laundy, for his work with the Building Ministers Forum, which brings together the relevant Commonwealth, state and territory ministers to set strategic directions for building and construction activity in Australia. The key issue that all governments have agreed requires priority focus is addressing building safety in ensuring appropriate compliance with the national code.\n"

That opens up the debate on how much the Commonwealth should be centrally controlling everything and how much we believe in federalism, diversification of power and the right of states to administer the things they were left to do under the Constitution. Things that weren't specifically mentioned in the Constitution as Commonwealth powers automatically become the responsibility of the states. That's how it has worked over the years.

You can see what happened with the Snowy Mountains scheme, and particularly Snowy 2.0, the brainchildâand love child, might I sayâof Prime Minister Turnbull. The Commonwealth is able to go in and do things there, whereas in my state of Queensland, as Senator Hanson knows, although the Commonwealth government can get feasibility studies done and provide money for water activity, we can't actually do it, because it is a responsibility of the state government. As Senator Hanson well knows, you cannot get the Queensland Labor government to do anything with water, because of the Greens political party which keeps them in powerâalthough I might say they're not the only party to do so; One Nation's preference arrangements also assisted. Because of that, you can never rely on some of the water regulation and storage projects desperately needed in my state of Queensland, and I suspect in other states also.\n"

They are in the code for a reason. The code was adopted by the Commonwealth and all of the state ministers at the ministerial forum. Each state agreed this code would apply. As I mentioned, it's then up to the regulatory enforcement authorities in the various states and territories to ensure those rules in the codeâwhich, as I understand, are replicated in state and territory legislationâare enforced.\n"

So I thank the mover for alerting the parliament to this. A number of Senate committees have dealt with similar issues, particularly following the fire in London last year. It is an important thing and I'm glad it is being discussed. The more we can draw attention to this, the more we can get community support for the proper enforcement of the laws which deal with construction within Australia.\n"

But now they are supporting a proposition that says that all products that are non-compliant should be bannedâall products. We know the situation with regard to the Australian building industry is one where the government is only too happy to fully regulate the building industry when it comes to controlling to reduce the wages and conditions of workers within the building industry. They are only too happy. They have no constitutional problems and there is no issue whatsoever about the capacity of the Commonwealth under a Liberal government to suppress the capacity of workers to protect themselves. But when it comes to the operations of crooks, of shysters, of people that have been ripping off the public, then this is a Commonwealth government that runs a million miles from its responsibilities in terms of public safety.

The evidence before this chamber has been overwhelming. Let me give one example in terms of the question of sprinklers in terms of plumbing products. The non-conforming building products inquiry heard that in the run-up to the G20 summit in Brisbane in 2014, the Australian Fire and Emergency Services Council conducted a safety audit of hotels in the Brisbane CBD, and 71 hotels were checked for the audit. These are the hotels that were, of course, the five-star hotels designed to accommodate the leaders of the global nations who were attending the G20, like President Obama and other guests in this country. Of the 71 hotels that were checked for audit, 68 were found to be not up to standard. The sprinkling systems were not up to standard in 68 of the 71. Why was that? Because simple arrangements have now been entered into in the building industry in this country where the certification system has become relationship based. That is, the owner of a buildingâa hotel, in this caseâgoes out and subcontracts out the certification arrangement, and under those circumstances they can get the findings they want on fundamental issues as to whether their sprinkler system is working properly and safely. The certifiers now know that their livelihoods depend upon keeping good relations with the building owners, or with the builders in terms of putting up a building. The responsibility for making sure that products and practices conform with appropriate standards has effectively been privatised.\n"

At the same time, the former, government-run building certification was privatised, and the industry underwent a process of 'deregulation or reduction in regulatory requirements around things like mandatory inspections'. So there is a fundamental flaw in the regulatory arrangements in this country.\n"

It is interesting to note that Liberal senators are supporting One Nation in bringing this matter on, continuing the ever-strengthening Liberal-One Nation alliance. And it is even more astonishing to hear Senator Macdonald, the senior Liberal in this placeâat least in terms of years servedâsaying 'any regulation or law deserves support'. I had to write that down to make sure I got it right! That is good to hear because this is a government that in so many areas completely ignores the laws it is required to enforce. And as Senator Carr just outlinedâreasonably eloquently!âalready they are completely ignoring their own standards, their own requirements and their own obligations in the area that is being talked about. As usual, they say it's the states' fault. Ensuring human safety, ensuring that humans and our environment are not poisoned, has been a core Greens value since the foundation of the Australian Greens.\n"

This government has a fixation on attacking not just the CFMEU but also teachers. Today there was a motion by the Liberals, which, sadly, was supported not just by the usual One Nation-Liberal alliance but by others as well, attacking teachers in Queensland for handing out a sticker with a flag on it. The government are so concerned about the safety of buildings that they want to attack the union that focuses on the safety of buildings to protect the people who have to live in those buildings. That's how concerned they are about human safety. They want to attack the organisation that, more than anything else, focuses on trying to ensure that the building materials are safe. And yet they have the astonishing gall to come in here and say that any law or regulation deserves support! Time and time again, this government deliberately seeks to undermine its own legal obligationsâin the environmental area, for starters. They completely and deliberately flout their obligations under our national environment laws and in so many other areas as well. I suppose we should be pleased that at least that statement from the government speaker is on the record, but it is hard to believe that it is actually genuine.\n"

We continually get attacked for red tape and green tape. What we are about is trying to ensure that sustainability, human safety and the basic rights and needs of the community are put first, rather than corporate profit. But we usually get attacked. Whilst there may be the usual hollow words that we have come to expect over quite a number of years now from Senator Macdonald, it is at least important to have that on the record.\n"

He was talking about regulation but in different forms or another. But I do note the work that he's done in relation to the number of inquiries, particularly around cladding.

One of the reasons for bringing it in was that they thought that nobody else could provide it as well. They were looking for quality assurance to be a competitive advantage for them in the marketplace with key customers, particularly government, that nobody else could offer. They would provide that assurance as part of their system of offering design-and-construct packages, particularly to government and to large corporate clients, as to how their project was going to comply not only with the specification but also with the construction codes. \n"

Again, the specifications are written in a way that refers back to compliance with the standards.

There are already rules, regulations and laws in place that deal with that. If you're providing a counterfeit product into the market, if it's not as you present it, it breaches not only consumer law but also other laws in respect of potential safety and a number of other things.\n"

It's been a significant expense to people who are looking to access their building, but also to other contractors through the system.

In circumstances where you've got an architect and an engineer working on a project, part of their job is to ensure that the products that are going into the building are as they have specified. For an engineer, their job is to design a structure such that it's structurally sound, and it's also part of their job to ensure that it's built to that standard, particularly if they are employed to do that, rather than just do the initial design. But there should be a process of ensuring that that's done, and the quality assurance system that I talked about earlier is certainly part of that process. But, in respect of other products that perhaps are not so much structural but part of the fit-out process, it's certainly up to the architects or the supervising agent to ensure that those products are what they specified they were. Substitution in the industry is not a new thing. I can recall submitting tenders and being required, if I wanted to put a substitute product in, particularly in government circumstances, to justify the fact that it was at least equivalent to the product in all aspects to the one that was specified in the specification.\n"

Quite frankly, from my perspective, those who are responsible for managing those things should manage those things. They shouldn't be passing it off to one level of government or another. One level of government shouldn't need to come in over the top of the other. The responsibilities are there for a purpose, and they should be complied with, in my view.\n"

Given it was a motion that wasn't about wedging anyone politicallyâit was about trying to address a very genuine need, which I accept is thereâI would encourage you to talk to us about these matters. We may have been able to get to a position of support for such a resolution, but, as it stands, we can't quite get there. We do support the bulk of it.

I was told by people when I started my apprenticeship: 'You really shouldn't be working with asbestos. It's unsafe.' Nonetheless, all our switchboards had asbestos surroundings. The manufacturer very cleverly renamed asbestos sheet as Zelemite and all sorts of other things. So, we were happily drilling it and putting enormous amounts of asbestos into an enclosed environment in which we were working.

You raised the point earlier, Senator Georgiou, about plumbers being pressured to use lead based fittings, and I'll come back to this, because I want to use this example. I and many other tradesmen with my employer started to say, 'We're simply not going to use asbestos anymore; we're just not going to do it', but if I tried to do that now I would have the ABCC down on me like a tonne of bricks. I would be deemed as taking unlawful industrial action, and I would be fined. I would be absolutely unable to push back. If my employer said, 'Well, bad luck; you will use those products,' there would be nothing I could do about it. And if I attempted to do something about it I would be in breach of the code of conduct of the building industry and I'd be prosecuted by the ABCC.\n"

That's where the priorities of this government are completely twisted and completely wrong. Senator Georgiou tells us that he's been talked to by plumbers who are now being pressured to use products that have lead in them, and I say to them that they'd better be very careful in pushing back about that. The fact that they have to go to their senator to complain about it, and not do something themselves in their own workplace, speaks volumes about the lack of rights and the lack of ability of working people in this country now to protect themselves from substandard productsâthings that are dangerous not only for the people they're being installed for but also for the people doing the installation.\n"

You are right to point outâand as I said earlier, and Senator Macdonald confirmedâthat people automatically assume that in this civilised country the things we're using have been deemed safe, that we would not allow things that are unsafe to be sold. But they're wrong, because there is no compliance. And whether it be just substitutionâand I accept that there is an element of criminal substitution, but that's not the whole problem; that's a part of the problemâthere are these products out there that can be used. The example of the aluminium cladding is, again, one of those classic examples, with a flammability rate higher than that of petrol. You are effectively surrounding your building with petrol and assuming that that's safe. Yet everyone who bought one of those apartments thinks, 'Well, surely the Australian government and the regulators that we employ would not allow a building to be built out of petrolâsurely not!' Yet we do, and we've failed to stop it. This Senate has done inquiries into that matter and made recommendations, and we've still failed to act. It's an absolute abrogation of our responsibility. Quite frankly, I'm gobsmacked.\n"

The cladding issue is a most serious public safety issue that requires urgent attention. The issue was brought to the public's attention in November 2014 when the Lacrosse building in Docklands in Melbourne caught fire. Since that time, governments, both federal and state, have failed to respond adequately. The Lacrosse incident was the trigger for the Senate inquiry. The Lacrosse apartment building in Docklands had aluminium cladding fixed to its exterior. Flames raced up several floors, and it was only through sheer luck that no lives were lost. Builders who consciously chose to cut costs by using non-compliant panels saved only about $3 per square metre, putting profit ahead of lives. I could talk about the follow-on fire in the Grenfell Tower where, sadly, the luck at Docklands was not present. I don't feel the need.\n"

I look up in the gallery and see primary school children that I fear may still be debating this topic when they are in the Senate.

It was interesting to go to a Westpac innovation hub and see people lining up to actually open a bank account.

They were delighted that we were there. We mixed with the crowd.

I will place it again on the record in this place that I've visited Manus Island five times in the last 12 months. I want to say that the many hundreds of men who Australia has abandoned on Manus Island are still there. They are still doing it tough. They still do not have adequate supports. Most of them have no idea what is going to happen to them in the future. And many of them have been profoundly harmed by the experience of the last five years; profoundly harmed by the indefinite detention to which the Australian and Papua New Guinean governments have subjected them; profoundly harmed by the lack of basic human services and supports; and profoundly harmed by becomingâthrough no fault of their own; through doing nothing wrong whatsoever other than stretching out a hand to Australia for assistanceâAustralia's political prisoners.\n"

The United Nations has time after time declared that Australia is in breach of international law and declared time after time that Australia is in breach of conventions that we have signed as a country. Our global reputation as a compassionate country is in tatters, and these peopleâthe men on Manus Island, and the men, women and children on Nauruâare still suffering every day as a result of the policy lockstep within which the Labor and Liberal parties are operating in this country.\n"

No matter how much members of the Labor and Liberal parties in this place and other parties that support the disgrace that is occurring on Manus Island and Nauru put their hands over their ears, there are still cries for help.

The provisions make it an offence for a person to enter or remain in certain areas in foreign countries that have been declared by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and where a listed terrorist organisation is engaging in hostilities. Two areas have been declared under the laws to date: the al-Raqqa province in Syria, for which a declaration was revoked in November, and the Mosul district in Iraq, which has been recently renewed. The committee concluded that the provisions remain necessary at this time and has recommended that they be continued for a further period of three years with an additional committee review prior to the new sunset date. The committee has also recommended amendments to the laws to clarify the existing exception relating to humanitarian aid; to increase transparency in relation to the range of non-legislative factors that are considered by the minister in determining which areas are to be declared; to provide the minister with an ability to revoke a declaration at any time; to take into account advice from security agencies; and to empower the committee to review and report back to the parliament on a declaration at its discretion at any time.\n"

In relation to the stop, search and seizure powers available to police under the Crimes Act, the committee has recommended increased reporting requirements and an ongoing oversight role for the committee. In relation to the control order regime, the committee has recommended amendments to provide greater clarity in relation to confirmation proceedings, to enable interim control orders to be amended on application, and to provide for extended supervision orders to be issued as an alternative to continuing detention orders.\n"

The threat of terrorism to Australian citizens remains, which is most serious, and it's appropriate that we have continuing laws that allow us to address this. However, when these laws were enacted, they were done so on the understanding that it was an extraordinary level of risk and that extraordinary measures ought to be put in place. It was acknowledged that they do in fact burden some of the ordinary protections that would ordinarily be in place in our criminal law, and to that end sunset provisions were included so that these bills would be under constant review. In making these recommendations, the committee has recommended that a sunset provision remain in place. This will allow the PJCIS to reconsider the need for this legislation, and whether it remains in an appropriate form within a specified period of time. These are important qualifications in relation to these laws, which are acknowledged to be extraordinary and exist only because of the seriousness of the threat that we are currently facing. Thank you.\n"

We opposed the amendment the Labor Party put up because it wasn't as good as the amendment we have put up. In 567FB the amount of payment is seven times better for the person. Previously it was only the Newstart payment; then there was a one-off payment two weeks later. My proposed amendment is far better for the people. No-one is going to be worse off under this. Some people are going to be better off with it. The government's costing for the bereavement was $1,040,000. It will cost a little bit more to instate this, but it is important that people in bereavement be looked after. That's why we put up this amendment. I understand you are going to support this amendment, and I'm pleased to hear that.\n"

It's an amendment to schedule 4. Schedule 4 of the bill closes bereavement allowance and provides support to bereaved persons through a new jobseeker payment or youth allowance from 20 March 2020. This amendment changes the formula for calculating payments to those who lose a partner, to ensure that no-one will receive less in financial support under the new arrangements than they would receive under the current system.

This amendment ensures that no bereaved person will be worse off with the cessation of the bereavement allowance. Bereavement allowance is paid at the pension rate of payment, compared to the jobseeker payment, which will be paid at the allowance rate of payment. As the bill is currently drafted, a bereaved person claiming jobseeker payment or youth allowance will receive a one-off lump sum payment, in addition to their ongoing fortnightly payment, following the death of their partner. To ensure that no bereaved person is worse off under the new jobseeker payment, this amendment will, from 20 March 2020, change the way payments are calculated for bereaved persons to ensure that there will be no difference between what a bereaved person will receive under the jobseeker payment or youth allowance and what they would receive under bereavement allowance. Again, they are the people Senator Hanson is referring to.\n"

Those who lose a partner do not have to apply for another payment as they do under the current system. Instead, they will receive an exemption from any mutual obligation requirements, to support them in their time of bereavement, and will seamlessly move into job search or other mutual obligation activities once the period of exemption ends.\n"

If we had voted against schedule 4 in this place then the existing entitlements, which means bereavement allowance paid at the age pension rate, would have been the status quo. Members of One Nation missed that vote and they came back into this place and asked for that vote to be recommitted because they agreed with the government. Now why are you moving this motion today if you agree with the government? The simple fact is: this is exactly contrary to what the government put forward yesterday and, what's more, it does not restore the entitlements for bereavement allowance to everyone who would have otherwise had it under the existing arrangements in the legislation. You should have stuck with your vote to reject schedule 4 yesterday because, had you voted it down, people would receive exactly the same rate as they do now, which is what you're seeking to do with this amendment. But what's more, your claim that no-one will be worse off is completely false, because those 30 persons a year will no longer be eligible for bereavement allowance.\n"

I think it is appropriate to direct them to her given that it is her amendment. I assume that this is something she's worked on very hard. My first question is simply: how is this amendment different to the amendment you voted against last night? If it refreshes your memory, last night, you, on two occasions, voted with the government to remove the bereavement allowance. We had to put the vote again because two of your senators missed the vote so they came back in and voted with the government, with the Liberal Party, to cut this allowance. I'm interested to know how it is that this amendment that you're now putting up, that you claim is about supporting the allowance, differs from the amendment that you personally voted against twice last night.\n"

Under the amendment that I have put forward, under 567FB, it would be the daily rate of youth allowance on the relevant day times 14, times seven. So the amendment that I am putting up has increased it considerably. The same is relevant to 660LI. It is the daily rate of a person's jobseeker payment on the relevant day, times 14, by two, under the government. Under my amendment, it would be the daily rate of a person's jobseeker payment on the relevant day by 14 by 4Â½ times. So it is a lot more for the person.\n"

Hence, although the One Nation party voted the way that we did last night, on reflection this is why we have put this amendment forward todayâbecause it should be there and we stand by that.

As the bill is currently drafted, from 20 March 2020 a bereaved person claiming youth allowance or jobseeker payment who is not pregnant will receive a one-off higher payment following the death of their partner. To ensure that no bereaved person is worse off under the new jobseeker payment, this amendment will change the way payments are calculated for bereaved persons from 20 March 2020, to ensure that there will be no difference between what a bereaved person receives under jobseeker payment or youth allowance compared to what they would've received under a bereavement allowance. With the removal of the potential difference in amounts between jobseeker payment and bereavement allowance, the new system provides a much better arrangement for those who are bereaved. Those who lose a partner do not have to apply for another payment, as they do under the current system. Instead, they receive an exemption from any mutual obligation requirements to support them in their time of bereavement and they will seamlessly move on into job search or other mutual obligation activities once the period of exemption ends. This will make the system simpler and maintain support for those experiencing one of the most difficult moments of crisis. I have moved my requests for amendment. I hope that they get the support of this chamber and that people stop playing party politics.\n"

I will be moving it because the situation with this schedule will be different if this amendment gets up. Senator Burston, you will have the chance to actually make sure nobody will be worse off because we will have the opportunity to vote down that schedule. I'm hoping you will lend support to my amendment that says: 'Let's get rid of this schedule because it is cruel to people who would have been able to access this allowance when they were in fact bereaved. They will now be excluded.' It is a fallacy to say that no-one will be worse off. It's too cute by half to say that when you are supporting a schedule that means that people will no longer be able to access this allowance.\n"

The answer is 960 people annually who would otherwise have claimed bereavement allowance will be able to claim the jobseeker payment or another payment. As I've also already stated, approximately 30 newly bereaved people per year would not qualify for the income support payment due to their income, assets or other circumstancesâfor example, their age. In terms of what this amendment does, most bereavement allowance recipients, as I've already stated, receive payment for 14 weeks at the higher pension rate. Without this amendment put forward by Senator Hanson, the total amount of jobseeker payments over the 14 weeks, including the lump sum payment, is estimated at approximately $1,300 less than the bereavement allowance paid for the same period. For youth allowance, the difference is estimated at approximately $2,200. So what this amendment will do is ensure that under the legislation that is currently before the Senateâand the government's amendment was passedâno bereaved person is worse off with the cessation of the bereavement allowance.\n"

There would be another 30 who would miss out on any payment altogether, so they'd be worse off still. The result of this amendment, you're saying, will essentially maintain the payment that 960 people would have received in the form of a bereavement allowance.

The government is simplifying the welfare system. As part of simplifying the welfare system, there will be the cessation of the bereavement allowance. The bill has not yet passed the Senate. In relation to the cessation of the bereavement allowance, as I've stated now several times on the record, from 20 March 2020, up to 960 people annually who would otherwise have claimed bereavement allowance will be able to claim jobseeker payment or another payment. Approximately 30 new bereaved people per year will not qualify for an income support payment due to their income, assets or other circumstances.\n"

Without this amendment, the total amount of jobseeker payment over the 14 weeks, including the lump sum payment, is estimated at around $1,300 less than the amount of bereavement allowance paid for the same period. For youth allowance, the difference is estimated at around $2,200. The effect of what Labor wants to do is to continue with the bereavement allowance and not simplify the system. We are committed to simplifying the system. This is what we have put forward. It is now for the Senate to determine if it agrees.\n"

We've got no guarantee that the value of the jobseeker bereavement period will retain its relativity to the age pension, because you've put in a completely different formula.

Does she want to have another opportunity to answer that question? She's looking at her papers, so I assume the answer's no. I might just also respond to Senator Cash, who accused me of verballing Senator Hanson when I said that Senator Hanson and her colleagues had spent the day claiming that their amendment was going to increase the bereavement allowance. I have in front of me a tweet from someone who used to haunt this place, Malcolm Roberts. His tweet at 4.39 pm this afternoon shared the amendment that we're currently debating and said, 'This is the amendment that is soon to be voted on in the Senate. It clearly shows an increase'âhe put that in big capital lettersâ'in support of pensioners who are', and I think he meant to say 'who are society's most vulnerable'. Does the minister want to retract her claim that I was verballing Senator Hanson and her colleagues?\n"

Let's be honest about what's happening here. What's happening here is that Senator Hanson and her colleagues are now scurrying back into this chamber to try to fix the mess that they created last night. They have been shamed into coming back into this chamber to reverse cuts to pensions and cuts to allowances that they voted for only last night. In Senator Hanson's case, she voted for them twice.\n"

This has been happening for so, so long, ever since Senator Hanson and her colleagues came to this chamber after the double dissolution. We've seen it on a range of workplace matters. Senator Hanson and her One Nation colleagues voted for the government's ABCC legislation. What was buried in there was that Senator Hansonâdespite all of her xenophobic remarks criticising foreigners, criticising migrantsâin voting, along with her colleagues, for the ABCC legislation made it easier for construction companies to bring in temporary overseas workers to replace local workers. If that's not selling out the battlers that she says that she represents, I don't know what is.\n"

They've actually cut the floor out from underneath the young battlers who they say that they are here to represent, by reducing the number of apprenticeships that are available to young people in the construction industry. In voting for that ABCC legislation, Senator Hanson and her One Nation colleagues also made it a hell of a lot easier for construction companies to bring in labour hire and keep people in insecure work. These are the people that Senator Hanson and her colleagues say that they are here to representâpeople in regional Queensland, in particular, and outer suburban areas who are really struggling to make ends meet, who are on labour hire rather than permanent work, who are in casual employment rather than permanent work, who are struggling to get an apprenticeship. Through Senator Hanson's own votes, she is actually making it harder still for these people, by removing what opportunities they do have.\n"

We've seen them do it on child care, by voting with the Liberals to cut childcare payments to low-income families.

Senator Hinch mentioned that he did. I'm not sure about some of the other crossbenchers. All of us were standing up for the battlers that you say you represent. Senator Hanson came over here, sat with the Liberals and voted to cut the bereavement allowance altogether, and two of her senators couldn't even be bothered showing up.

They can support our amendments on the wife pension in terms of overseas portability.

But there is still an opportunity to knock that off. It's 30 a year, don't forget. It is not just 30 people but 30 a year.\n"

The intention of this amendment being put by One Nation, as I understand it, is to maintain its relativity with the current rate. Now, that current rate is the rate of the age pension, so you must have done something that helps you arrive at the equivalent of the age pension rate. I can see how you would do that by calculating the amount of the youth allowance or the jobseeker payment, and then adding on the difference over the 14 weeks of what it otherwise would have been under your age pension.

We've established that. As the bill is currently drafted, a bereaved person claiming jobseeker payment or youth allowance will receive a one-off lump sum payment following the death of their partner, in addition to their ongoing fortnightly payment. To ensure that no bereaved person is worse off under the new jobseeker payment, the amendment that we are currently looking at will change the way the payments are calculated for bereaved persons from 20 March 2020 to ensure that there will be no difference between what a bereaved person receives under jobseeker payment or youth allowance compared to what they would have received under the bereavement allowance.\n"

Without this amendment, the total amount of the jobseeker payment over the 14 weeks, including the lump sum payment, was estimated by the department to be approximately $1,300 less than the amount of the bereavement allowance paid for the same period. In relation to the youth allowance, the difference is estimated at approximately $2,200. They will now receive that additional payment, which takes them back to what they would've received.\n"

It goes back to the top-up payment, as it was attached to the daily rate of a person's youth allowance plus the top-up, which is not as much as it would've been over the equivalent time. So you have calculated a top-up that is relative to the age pension as it stands currently, but it will maintain its relativity to the original payment, not to the age pension?\n"

The potential difference between the amount of the jobseeker payment and the amount of the bereavement allowance will be removed. The new system is actually a much better arrangement for those who are bereaved, because those who lose a partner will not now have to go through the process of applying for another payment. They have to do that under the current system. The system that is proposed is streamlined and simplified, and they receive an exemption to support them through their time of bereavement. They then seamlessly move into job search or other mutual obligation activities once the period of exemption ends.\n"

Now, I understand that you're trying to argue that people don't need to reapply if they're already eligible as jobseekers. But the simple fact is that your schedule, amended or unamended, does away with the whole category of bereavement as a separate category; it rolls it into a jobseeker allowance. It seems reasonable that the expectation there would be that people are actually jobseekers. The simple fact is that this is the social safety net for people who are bereaved. It's not that they're necessarily looking for a job. It is simply that they are without a job at that moment in time precisely because they are bereaved. They don't have access to other employment entitlements that see them through that period of bereavement.\n"

We believe that, in setting up this process and changing the compliance frameworkâand I think there is pretty universal agreement that we do need to change the compliance frameworkâwe didn't undertake that full independent review. So we thought it was really important, given that that wasn't done. Even though we had a second reading amendment about it being done, that wasn't going to happen before the government brought on their legislation.

Your amendment would require the minister to commission annual independent reviews of the jobseeker compliance framework with the first to be completed within 12 months of the targeted compliance framework commencing. The government will be opposing this amendment. As I have already stated, the government has already committed to a review of the targeted compliance framework 18 months after the commencement. This review would, of course, look at the effectiveness of the framework and any unintended adverse effects, taking into account the views of relevant experts and stakeholders. There is no need to legislate a review requirement, and legislating the personnel, terms of reference and timing removes flexibility to focus on particular issues, should it be necessary at that particular point in time.\n"

It was also based on detailed analysis of the administrative data, utilising expertise drawn from three government departments. Going to your question on the review, as I've stated, the effectiveness of the framework and any unintended adverse effects will take into account the views of relative experts and stakeholder groups.

So I express deep concern around the fact that it's not independent and I seek a guarantee from the government around the time frame of the reviewâthat it will be released to the public and that it will be released in a timely manner.\n"

The community is quite concerned about that, and I've expressed concern about that here. The government have not agreed to changes from ourselves and from the Labor Party that I think would have made the system better. The government designed this framework. They're now going to review it internally, and there is no commitment that this will be made public. Will this review be worth the paper it's written on, if we can't see it? Surely the government can commit to making the review public. I find it hard to believe that the government expects the Senate to accept that they're doing an internal review that won't be made public. How is that satisfactory, when people don't have confidence in such major changes to the compliance framework? Surely you can commit to it being made public.\n"

Nowhere is this truer than in my home state of Western Australia. For most people, WA is synonymous, and rightly so, with the resource sectorâiron ore, gold, diamonds, oil and natural gas, all major industries which have long contributed to Australia's economic wealth, creating jobs, establishing infrastructure and improving regional communities along the way. However, agriculture has always been, and will always be, an important contributor to the Western Australian economy.\n"

According to the latest ABS statistics, WA gross farmgate values have risen from $5.4 billion to $8.16 billion over the past four years, and, due to increasing domestic and international demand and investment, the sector is expected to double its current contribution of $8.6 billion per annum to the state's economy over the next 12 years. Overall, broadacre farm cash income in Western Australia is estimated to have increased from an average of $312,700 per farm in 2015-16 to $340,000 per farm in 2016-17, which is around 90 per cent above the 10-year average for 2015-16.

In stark contrast to the disappointing end to the season in the eastern states, many West Australian farmers can expect to return a profit on what could've been a disastrous year. For many, this profit has been boosted, with the state's largest grain handler, CBH Group, returning its largest ever surplus and biggest ever rebate to growers, following the previous season's record of a 16.6 million tonne harvest. In the 2016-17 year to September 2017, CBH generated a record surplus, before rebates, of $247 million, up 120 per cent on 2015-16. This enabled it to return a total of $156.3 million to growers through enhanced rebate offerings with more flexible options, an increase of 150 per cent on the previous year's rebates.\n"

This is the highest Western Wool Centre turnover since June 1997, when the sale of 45,275 bales generated $34.3 million.

This compared to a national net confidence rating of minus two per cent, down from 16 per cent in the December quarter, one of its lowest levels over the last four years. Only six per cent of WA producers held a negative outlook for the coming year, down from 11 per cent previously and compared to 21 per cent nationally. In WA, 61 per cent were anticipating conditions similar to last year, and 29 per cent expected an even better year ahead. As well as feeling more confident about their income outlook this year, WA producers have indicated their highest level of intention to invest in their businesses since early 2008. The year is indeed looking good already.\n"

In fact, the government wants a civil society that is silenced, that is unable to comment on, debate or criticise any government policy. The Turnbull government is continuing the campaign that was started by Mr Howard and continued by Mr Abbott. Mr Turnbull is following in their footsteps. Preventing foreign interference in Australia is important. Indeed, the Greens have long called for a ban on foreign donations to political parties, but the impact of these bills is far-reaching, and they don't fix the problems they seek to address. \n"

Professor Twomey notes that this could include anything from expenditure on ads supporting marriage equality, to books on climate change, to websites supporting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander recognition. The bill will force some charities to choose between public advocacy and accepting international philanthropy. It will tie up many in bureaucratic knots, forcing them to detail political expenditure and their senior employees' membership of political parties, and it will require statutory declarations from any donor who cumulatively gives more than $250 annually, an onerous burden that will certainly impact on charitable giving in this country.\n"

The campaign against independent, progressive voices began some time ago, as I articulated earlier. But in 2016 we witnessed the relentless government criticism of the independent Human Rights Commission and its then commissioner, Gillian Triggs, simply because the government did not like what the commission had to say. The government established the Registered Organisations Commission with the express purpose of attacking unions. The Australian Electoral Commission is investigating GetUp! for being an 'associated entity', which basically means a front groupâfor not one but two political parties. Previous conservative governments put in place gag clauses that tried to take away the DGR status of various organisations. This suite of bills seems to be the culmination of this worrying pattern of behaviour, where a government in trouble seeks to use the apparatus of the state to stifle dissent. That is what this is about. The Greens will not stand for this. We will oppose this attack on civil society. We won't be supporting these bills, and we urge the crossbenchers and the ALP to stand with us in opposing these bills. (Time expired)\n"

Vanessa was no stranger to politics, contesting the 2006 state election in the electorate of Franklin and then, a year later, contesting the 2007 federal election in the seat of Franklin and then, finally, contesting the Pembroke by-election for the upper house state seat, in the south, in 2009, winning it for the Liberals.\n"

One only had to have a close look at Dr Goodwin's first speech, which she delivered in 2009, after her election, to see what kind of a person she truly was and to see what excited her, what motivated her to do the good things that she did. Vanessa in that speech charted out, early on, her priorities, the things that mattered to her. Chief amongst them was the restoration of trust in government. Vanessa was one of those members of the Tasmanian parliament who led the charge in supporting the idea of the establishment of an integrity commission, a tool which she believed might restore some of the public faith in the democratic institutions of our state. Ahead of her time, she led that debate, and indeed we saw the establishment of an integrity commission.\n"

This is something that she continued to work on for the duration of her career, something she was ardently passionate about and something that was born out of the studies that she conducted at the University of Tasmania and Cambridge university. Her deep passion for the area of crime prevention for younger Tasmanians was a hallmark of much of the work that Vanessa did as a member of the Legislative Council and then later as the state's Attorney-General, Minister for Justice and Minister for Corrections. She supported innovative programs like TOOL and U-Turn, which had new ways of tackling youth crime and breaking that cycle that young offenders find themselves in.\n"

For many years, Vanessa contributed to the life of the Liberal Party in our state. If public opinion is to be believed, politicians are rarely believed to have a beating heart, but I can say for a fact that Vanessa Goodwin truly did have one. Just recently, on Friday, 9 March, there was a fitting tribute to Vanessa, to her life and to the contribution that she made to her state, marked by a packed-out St David's cathedral, where we were able to say farewell to our friend and colleague and a great Tasmanian. On behalf of all Tasmanians, including my colleague Senator Bushby, I can say definitely that Tasmania, and our lives, will be much the poorer without her.\n"

Golding and CLAN CEO Leonie Sheedy graphically pointed out that, for years, all the headlines, all the attention, had been on sexual abuse of children in institutions, when in fact many of the around 500,000 Aussie kids who had been in state and church care had been also emotionally and physically abusedâused as child labour, used as child sex slaves, cleaning the orphanages, working in the vegie gardens. At a later meeting with Golding and Sheedy, I was told about three sisters brought up by nuns in a Catholic orphanage. Their education was curtailedâthey didn't even get to high schoolâbecause they were given the job of looking after disabled children in the institution. They also deserve redress in both financial and counselling terms.

The manager was Captain Victor Bennett, who administered the corporal punishment. After many beatings, Brian stole a bike and ran away. Taken back home by the police, he was punished. He got six of the best on his hands and his naked backside. Then Captain Bennett ordered him to spend the next week naked with welts on his buttocks from the flogging. He would work, line up for meals and sleep on empty potato sacks naked. How perverse is that?

He's already done town halls in Townsville, in Mackay, which I was lucky enough to attend, and also in Rockhampton, and tonight he is in Gladstone with our fantastic Labor candidate for Flynn, Zac Beers, who ran last time and got very close but is running again. When we did our town forum in Mackay, we had with us Belinda Hassan, our candidate for Dawson. It's been fantastic to help those candidates get off to a flying start.\n"

If they actually spent any time in these regional communities, they'd understand how disappointed local businesses are that it's taken so long for this money to be promised. It took more than 12 months for the guidelines to be put out, let alone for anyone to actually make a decision about local businesses. Federal Labor doesn't want to look back after five years in government and say, 'What have we done?' We are listening now and we're going to ensure that we can start delivering for these communities if we win the next federal election.

We see those opposite refusing to fund the full amount that is needed to go halves with the state in Rookwood Weir. We're excited about the agriculture jobs we'll deliver.

That way there is no delay. They can be confident that there's an ongoing pipeline of work that will ensure that they can continue to operate and live locally in those towns, and the community also can have some certainty about that next stage of the ring- road taking place.

In June last year the Senate passed the Passports Legislation Amendment (Overseas Travel by Child Sex Offenders) Bill 2017 with the support of the Nick Xenophon Team. The effect of this bill was to prevent convicted Australian child sex offenders who are on the sex offender registry from travelling overseas. This is to prevent them from sexually abusing vulnerable children in countries such as the Philippines, Thailand and Cambodia, where the law enforcement framework is very much weaker and the activities of offenders are not monitored. This bill has proven very effective in its stated aims. However, the government's success in preventing registered sex offenders from travelling overseas to exploit children has had, very much, a sickening consequence. As reported by the International Justice Mission, a flood of paedophiles are now paying as little as $12 to watch a child be abused live via Skype. In many instances, this is also being facilitated by parentsâ$12 to watch a child being abused via Skype.\n"

The Senate did not support Skye's amendments in the circumstances where there was insufficient time to consider them after the government brought forward the bill. There has been enough delay in doing something about this. We all need to act now. I know Skye remains passionate about this issue. She travelled with the International Justice Mission last year at her own expense to see firsthand the incredibly powerful work the organisation does in rescuing children from sexual abuse. What she learned shocked her. She also learned that the demand for online sexual abuse is mainly from Western countries such as Australia. We need to take the responsibility for these evil people and do what we can do as legislators to stop them perpetrating abuse of vulnerable children, not just here but also overseas.\n"

In September the government took up Skye's amendments to combat cybersex trafficking, along with other important measures to protect vulnerable children, with the introduction of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sexual Crimes Against Children and Community Protection Measures) Bill 2017. That was over six months ago, and over nine months since the bill preventing Australian convicted child sex offenders from travelling. Let's bring this bill onâbring it on soon. Arguably, every other bill we are debating is not as important as this one. We need to act, and we need to stop delaying. The longer we wait, the more children are hurt.\n"

A UN report from 2009, citing FBI statistics, stated that there were a quarter of a million paedophiles online at any point in time. That was nearly a decade ago. Imagine what that number is now. The same report estimated that the industry that produces child-abuse material generates between $3 billion and $20 billion per year. \n"

It is much worse for First Nations women. So I sought, in a very small way, to try and redress that in Western Australia. I spoke to some Noongar women I know about an idea I had last year to hold a First Nations women's forum in Western Australia.

Noongar elders Mingli McGlade and Liz Hayden started the ceremony for us. We then heard from Charne Hayden.

From within this unassuming structure in Melbourne's Southbank, 250 entities are at work. Simultaneously interlinked with colleagues across the nation and the globe, they pour heart and soul into the forging of new worlds, the reshaping of old narratives, the breaking down of the barriers that divide us, and the exportation of wonder to the world, all without wreaking irrevocable damage to the biosphere.\n"

Under Prime Ministers Abbott and Turnbull there has been a hostility to civil society. First, there was a push to prevent environmental groups from intervening in court matters. There has been talk of denying charitable status to organisations that engage in advocacy. Charities that deliver social services have been forced to sign gag clauses that prevent them from speaking out on policy issues. Civil society plays a unique and important role in public debate. But this government has been so busy protecting people's rights to be bigots that they have forgotten why free speech is important to begin with. \n"

The Prime Minister and Minister Angus Taylor, the minister responsible for emergency management agencies, and I visited Tathra over the last 24 hours. Tathra, as many people in this chamber will know, is a picture-perfect seaside town on the southern coast of New South Wales at the mouth of the Bega River. It's truly a jewel in the stunning Sapphire Coast. It's a close-knit community, and it's enjoyed a wonderful way of life that's rich in history and long in maritime tradition. \n"

As of a few hours ago, 398 houses had been saved or were not affected by the fire, 69 houses had been destroyed, 39 houses suffered significant damage and 30 cabins or caravans had been destroyed, but there was not one death or serious injury. \n"

There were damaged and destroyed houses, helicopters flying with long, dangling buckets, and lines of fire trucks and firefighters on the sides of roads waiting for the next task or about to deploy home, or with crews asleep around them. On surrounding roads were convoys of fire trucks or individual fire trucks coming in to replace tired crewsâmen and women firefighters with the pride and honour of being blackened. There's a great honour in that kind of blackness for a firefighter because it means they were successful in defending most homes. Some were still fighting fires on the ground, mostly individual smoking trees or stumps, or blacking out. Blacking out is about the most thankless task for any firefighter. There were helicopter bases on sports ovals, tankers of fuel, maintenance crews and wind socks, with helicopters coming in and going out. Hoses were laid out behind trucks to be rolled up. There were RFS command vehicles and even a deployed RFS semitrailer full of something it had delivered. But what we saw everywhere was the comradeship of men and women who knew they'd done a good job and the best job that could be done.\n"

The police also kept overenthusiastic residents from going back into areas with live wires or dangerous asbestos. So they, the police themselves, were in fact lifesavers. We also saw skilled communications crews and electricity crews tucked into strange places by the side of roads here and there in small trucks but also larger trucks with poles on the back and big rolls of new wire and cables to replace everything and erector vehicles. There were vehicles towing generators, and there were generators being connected to critical infrastructure such as phone switches, mobile towers, sewerage works and the evacuation centre. Also, we saw assessors travelling around the town trying to see who lost and who won out of this tragic lottery, asking, 'Is this house okay, damaged or destroyed?' and getting the addresses to convey to the evacuees later.\n"

We saw the media, who were there to tell the rest of Australia what was going on in Tathra, and, from what I could see, with a good degree of consideration. They were considerate of the houses destroyed, of the people who were evacuated and of the officials whose job it was to help. Inside the evacuation centre was the slickness of this nation of ours. We are practised at helping our own people after disasters. The team came together under the local incident commander from, I think, Bermagui. He conducted the action with a sensitivity that was beautiful to watch. The locals unaffected by the fires had, within hours, contributed everything that the homeless needed, from bedding to clothes to toilet gear, and there were chaplains dispensing massive amounts of understanding.\n"

It's unfair to mention who was there because I will definitely forget someone, but Anglicare was there, as were other church groups, hotel and motel catering staff, officials who could say what the relief entitlements were and Woolies, of course, to give stuff away. That's because everyone is part of the community that is Tathra, Bega and the whole Bega Valley. Everyone had their own story and was keen to tell it for impact but also as a relief.\n"

The state local member, Andrew Constance, was all over the place, talking, relating, caring and fixing what he could. Mike Kelly, the local federal member, was there, as was Bill Shorten today, proving what we all knowâthat caring crosses political lines. Premier Berejiklian was there and got around to most places. Local media personality Ian Campbell was everywhere, was trusted by everyone and was doing marvellous work. With the Premier was the commissioner of the Rural Fire Service, Shane Fitzsimmons.

If you put the firefighting and recovery experience of Shane Fitzsimmons, Mark Crosweller and Euan Ferguson together, you would get about 100 years of rural firefighting experience, as well as an amazing amount of leadership. We are well served. And of course the Prime Minister was there. He spoke with locals affected and not affected. He spoke to fire crews, helicopter crews, helpers and children.

I won't repeat the questions, because some of them have no substance and some are, sadly, exploitative. These are the normal questions. They may be valid or they may not be, but they will need to be checked in due course.

If there's anything that demonstrates how out of touch the government are, it's this issue. They have displayed a lack of regard for some of the most vulnerable older Australians.

The release of the latest data on the Turnbull government's home care packages has revealed that close to 105,000 vulnerable Australians are waiting for care. This is the care that they receive at home. This includes close to 82,000 older Australians waiting with high needs such as dementia. Staggeringly, 45.8 per cent of people on the waiting list are receiving a lower level of care than they need. This isn't good enough.\n"

The waiting list, based on the Department of Health's own numbers, tops 2Â½ thousand older Tasmanians, and that is growing.

They're ending up at accident and emergency in acute hospitals, which is the last place that older people should be. They just need to have the support to keep them well and healthy and in their own homes. You can't keep passing the buck on these things.

The rainforests of Ecuador are some of the most diverse in the world, with many endemic and endangered species of plants and animals. The reserve is now threatened. Former Ecuadorian vice-president Jorge Glas secretly granted mining concessions across 13 per cent of the country. The protected forest of Los Cedros is located within land that can now be mined.

While Lenin Moreno, the new Ecuadorian president elected last year, has promised that there will be no new oil and mining concessions, this has not been enough for the Indigenous communities and their supporters. They are calling for the concessions made by the previous government to be rescinded. Ecuador's protected forest are considered to be one of the most critical global conservation priorities. The impacts of large-scale open pit mining within rainforests cannot be understated. Deforestation, species loss, erosion, contamination of water systems and desertification will occur if mining is allowed to proceed. \n"

We must also urge Australian mining companies not to follow the Canadian company Cornerstone into the unique forest systems and indigenous lands of Ecuador. Now is the time to encourage Ecuador's government to abide by its own constitution. Surely President Moreno will not allow the short-term profits from mining companies to win the day. That path will leave behind a spoilt and impoverished landscape, unable to sustain the people or creatures that rely on it.

In this case the issue is not the acquisition; the problem is how it's done. The Prince of Wales project involved several hundred people living in 89 properties.

We have seven households that have been in their homes in our communities for over 50 years, 25 per cent of households have been there for more than 40 years and over 50 per cent have been in their homes for 20 years or more. More than half the homes being acquired by the government have had children grow up in them, parents die, and lifetime friends live next door and across the road.

Alternative housing in this area is scarce and expensive, and, until recently, little or no assistance was given to residents to find alternative housing. In New South Wales some 400 people are affected in this way every year.

It is Machado-Joseph disease. It's a hereditary neurodegenerative condition, and the damage that it causes to the cerebellum and brain stem initially causes muscular weakness and progresses over time to a total lack of voluntary control. It causes very significant permanent physical disability. It does impact largely, unfortunately, just in one pocket area. The spread of MJD is in Arnhem Land.\n"

Entry into the Australian population was thought to have been through trading relationships between the Aboriginal people of Arnhem Land and the Macassan people of Indonesia, who in turn traded with the Portuguese. However, in February 2012, research was published which effectively rules out the Portuguese linkâthat is what it initially wasâand instead points to a direct Asian link based on international DNA. This means that the type of MJD experienced in northern Australia is most like the Asian variant of the disease, and this is known to favour an aggressive anticipation effect. The MJD Foundation knows therefore that more people will develop the disease earlier than their parents in this current population.\n"

In Central Australia there are affected families in Papunya, Hermannsburg and Santa Teresa. There are also some families who have MJD in mainland Queensland around Cairns, Kuranda and Atherton. So why does the MJD Foundation focus on Aboriginal Australians? Largely because, in the Northern Territory, Aboriginal Australians have a prevalence of this disease 100 times greater than the international average, and many Aboriginal Australians with MJD also live in remote communities. Therefore, there are significant gaps in services compared with those available in non-remote settings. So this foundation is incredibly important.\n"

The study dismissed suggestions that a cancer cluster existed on a heavily contaminated area of Cabbage Tree Road. Over the last 15 years, 50 cancer cases have occurred over a five-kilometre stretch on that road. The results of the study are totally unreliable and lack objectivity. Areas such as Medowie and Karuah were included in the study despite being some 30 kilometres from the red zone.

She misled parliament on five occasions by claiming that no-one in her office alerted the media to Federal Police raids on the AWU offices, raids instigated by her creation the Registered Organisations Commission. She hid behind claims of public interest immunity in order to avoid legitimate questioning about the involvement of herself and her staff in providing advice to the media about the raid on the AWU office.

People aren't going to read all the UN proclamations, and they probably don't want to wade through a lot of academic research either. But, when you see the animation Lea Goes to School, the message is clearly placed in the voice of a young girl who, when directed towards a special route that would give her special education and special jobs, to live separately in a special way, she stands up and boldly says, 'I'm not specialâI'm Lea.'

One of her strongest campaign volunteers was her brother Callum, who worked on this campaign to help his sister in a tough fight to go into the state parliament of Queensland. Callum was described as an integral part of that team from the very beginning. He wanted to help his sister, and he brought his own special skills to the campaign. He was valued and enjoyed working with the other team members. His skills included making tea and coffee for the team when they got together for meetings or campaigning activities, helping out on the barbecue, and even taking part in something that I don't always enjoy, which is the doorknocking campaign. But apparently Callum really enjoyed it. We know now that Meaghan Scanlon did win that election and is now the newly elected member for Gaven in the state parliament, and a ministerâthe youngest woman minister in the history of the Queensland parliament. On the day that Meaghan was sworn in, Callum and his friends from the campaign and his mum were there together to share in the experience of welcoming Meaghan into the Queensland parliament. \n"

I'd firstly like to particularly note and pay tribute to a whole range of people in the community on the Gold Coast who have worked for a number of years to protect a small but nonetheless special piece of land known as Black Swan Lake. This area in Bundall, on the Gold Coastâvery close, unfortunately for it, to the Gold Coast Turf Clubâis a freshwater lake, home to 40 species of wild birds. It was excavated over 30 years ago. It has regrowth bushland at the western end.\n"

The trucks arrived to start filling it in, in spite of the presence of nesting swans, and the community managed to prevent that. They've been fighting to protect that lake ever since. Despite that, the Gold Coast city council in 2016 gave the turf club control of the lake and gave the turf club the right to fill it in. The community has continued to fight since that time, and, even when the trucks finally started arriving and started pouring the dirt into that lake, they kept fighting. And it is wonderful to see that the filling in of that lake has stopped, at least for the moment.\n"

I visited that area a few weeks ago on a particularly rainy day and, despite the rain, was met by a large number of local people. I saw the swans on the lake. I saw the destruction that had already started to be wreaked on that area. I urge the Gold Coast city council to reconsider their decision. I gather they're meeting again this Friday. I'm sure the local community will once again be present to ask them to reconsider that. This is a classic case of local residents having to raise money and launch campaigns because their so-called representatives are more interested in putting the interests of their donors and the corporate sector ahead of the local community and what it wants to see for its own area.\n"

For this to be filled in with a car park is extraordinary. For the Gold Coast Turf Club to be required to pay the city council just $1 a year under a licence deal to use that area once it is filled in is a travesty, to put it politely.

This decision was made despite the fact that the Senate and the parliament were actually in the process, and had been for a number of days, of debating whether or not our country should be supporting that. So, whilst our parliament's representatives were debating whether or not our country should be involved in this war, our government decided to let it rip anyway.

This was a perfect exampleâif the word 'perfect' can be applied to something so abominableâof why all of our political parties, and our governments, in particular, need to listen to the community, particularly when the message is so unbelievably clear.

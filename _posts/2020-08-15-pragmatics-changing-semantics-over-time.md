questions:
  - question: 'What are these plots?'
    answer: 'Meaning (semantics) can be influenced by context (pragmatics). What we have here are the top 5 words that cause a positive correlation to the overall semantics by their proximity to the keywords. As the words that have the most influence are mostly constant over time, this suggests a change in emotional response to the keywords over time. Notice anti-correlations.'
